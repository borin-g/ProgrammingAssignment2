## Make 'special' matrix which has our own defined functionalities,
## then it can be inversed

## 'special' matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## If the 'special' matrix input has its inverse, just return it;
## no need to calculate it again, otherwise, compute its inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
